description: "I am a Software Engineer, not a Manager. This is the story I tell myself on a regular basis since being promoted to a Delivery Management role. Now, after more than one year in this role, it is time to reflect on my journey so far. To share my experience from the perspective of a reluctant leader."

## The Ideal Leader

As a software engineer, if asked what characteristics my ideal leader have, I would conclude that the leader know my job well enough that they could empathise with me, understanding the difficulties of my role. They could then use this understanding to advocate for me with the rest of the organisation.

## Is an Ideal Software Engineer's Leader, a Software Engineer?

Given the characteristics I described in [The Ideal Leader](#the-ideal-leader), it would be logical to conclude that the best leader for a Software Engineer was previously a Software Engineer. They can empathise effectively because they could do their job if required. The problem I have experienced with this conclusion is that a Software Engineer when becoming a leader, wants now to be both a Software Engineer, and a leader. I have found that these two roles form an unavoidable dichotomy. As such, for a Software Engineer to become a leader of Software Engineers, they need to take a step back from the skill-set that likely got them noticed in the first place.
