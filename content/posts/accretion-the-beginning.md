## The Problem

A Product is made from a large collection of discrete components that can become difficult for Product Teams to manage, and even more difficult for newcomers to comprehend.

## The Proposal

> Manage internal technical documentation that is enriched with live data accreted from your environment.

This proposal highlights the value of technical documentation, with the understanding that it can quickly become out of date when referring to specific resources in your environment. This is where enrichment of live data from your environment is critical.

## Open Source

Accretion will be [developed in the open (github.com)](https://github.com/dbtedman/accretion), and released under an [open source license (github.com)](https://github.com/dbtedman/accretion/blob/main/LICENSE.md).

## Secure by Design

Implementation will presume from day 1 that being secure is a critical requirement for this solution. The [OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (owasp.org)](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/) is going to be used as a guide when making implementation decisions, and to assist with assessing security after the fact.

## Follow Along

You can follow [development as it happens (github.com)](https://github.com/dbtedman/accretion), with in depth analysis and commentary [on this site (tedman.dev)](/topics/accretion/).
