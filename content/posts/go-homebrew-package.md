## Goal

To allow for installing our go binary `aquamarine` on macOS using Homebrew.

## Assumptions

-   A go project exists with a functional binary.
-   GitHub Actions will be used for automating the release.
-   Go Releaser will be used to coordinate the go build.
-   A Homebrew Tap will be used, instead of publishing via the [homebrew-core](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core)
    repository.

## Go Releaser Build

[GoReleaser (goreleaser.com)](https://goreleaser.com) is used to automate build and release processes, for a multi-os, multi-architecture Go binary.

To configure GoReleaser, begin by creating a `.goreleaser.yml` file based on the following template:

```yaml
before:
    hooks:
        - "go mod tidy"

builds:
    - id: "aquamarine"
      binary: "aquamarine"
      # Path to the main.go for the binary you want to compile.
      main: "cmd/aquamarine/main.go"
      env:
          # Build a statically-linked binary without external dependencies.
          - "CGO_ENABLED=0"
      mod_timestamp: "{{ .CommitTimestamp }}"
      flags:
          # Remove all file system paths from the resulting executable.
          - "-trimpath"
      ldflags:
          # Omit the symbol table and debug information.
          - "-s"
          # Omit the DWARF symbol table.
          - "-w"
          # Populate build information into version variables. In this example,
          # the aquamarine binary embeds the current build details, so we need
          # to provide them in the following lines.
          - "-X github.com/dbtedman/conveyance/cmd.version={{.Version}}"
          - "-X github.com/dbtedman/conveyance/cmd.commit={{.Commit}}"
          - "-X github.com/dbtedman/conveyance/cmd.date={{.CommitDate}}"
      goos:
          # Choose the operating systems you want to target.
          - "linux"
          - "darwin"
          - "windows"
      goarch:
          # Choose the architectures you want to target.
          - "amd64"
          - "arm64"
```

## GitHub Actions CI

We want to build our binary automatically on commits to our code repository, we are using [GitHub Actions (docs.github.com)](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) for this purpose.

In your code repository, create a GitHub Actions workflow configuration `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, based on the following template:

```yaml
name: "ci"

on:
    pull_request:
        branches:
            - "main"
    push:
        branches:
            - "main"

permissions: "read-all"

jobs:
    linux:
        runs-on: "ubuntu-latest"

        steps:
            - name: "Checkout Code"
              uses: "actions/checkout@4.1.1"
            - name: "Setup Go"
              uses: "actions/setup-go@4.1.0"
              with:
                  # Go version in use will be selected based on your module definition.
                  go-version-file: "./go.mod"
            - name: "Build"
              uses: "goreleaser/goreleaser-action@5.0.0"
              with:
                  version: "latest"
                  args: "build --clean --snapshot"
```

This configuration will cause a pipeline to execute on each commit to the `main` branch, or any Pull Requests that target `main` branch.

Push the changes to your remote repository, and confirm in the GitHub UI that a pipeline has been executed.

## Homebrew Tap

A Homebrew Tap provides an alternative to publishing to the primary Homebrew repository, in a code repository you control.

Create an empty repository [github.com/dbtedman/homebrew-tap](https://github.com/dbtedman/homebrew-tap) for this purpose.

> ðŸ’¡ It is important to name the repository `homebrew-tap` as this is expected by the `brew install` command so that the formula can be referenced as `dbtedman/tap/aquamarine`.

## Go Releaser Release

Now that we can build our binary in our pipeline, we need to prepare our GoReleaser configuration for publishing to Homebrew.

Modify your GoReleaser configuration `.goreleaser.yml`, according to the following:

```yaml
archives:
    - format: "binary"
      id: "aquamarine_binary"
      builds:
          - "aquamarine"
      name_template: "aquamarine_{{ .Version }}_{{ .Os }}_{{ .Arch }}"
    - format: "zip"
      id: "zip"
      name_template: "{{ .Binary }}_{{ .Version }}_{{ .Os }}_{{ .Arch }}"

checksum:
    name_template: "{{ .ProjectName }}_{{ .Version }}_SHA256SUMS"
    algorithm: "sha256"

brews:
    - name: "aquamarine"
      ids:
          - "aquamarine_binary"
      # Configuration for the homebrew tap created in the previous step.
      repository:
          owner: "dbtedman"
          name: "homebrew-tap"
          branch: "main"
          token: "{{ .Env.HOMEBREW_TAP_GITHUB_TOKEN }}"
      homepage: "https://github.com/dbtedman/stop"
      description: "Provide security by proxying requests to legacy applications."
      license: "MIT"
      folder: "Formula"
```

## GitHub Actions Release

We want to release our binary automatically on tags in our code repository, as was done for builds, we are using GitHub Actions for this purpose.

```yaml
name: "release"

on:
    push:
        tags:
            - "*"

permissions: "read-all"

jobs:
    release:
        runs-on: "ubuntu-latest"

        permissions:
            contents: "write"

        steps:
            - name: "Checkout Code"
              uses: "actions/checkout@4.1.1"
              with:
                  fetch-depth: 0
            - name: "Setup Go"
              uses: "actions/setup-go@4.1.0"
              with:
                  # Go version in use will be selected based on your module definition.
                  go-version-file: "./go.mod"
            - name: "Release"
              uses: "goreleaser/goreleaser-action@5.0.0"
              id: "release"
              with:
                  version: "latest"
                  args: "release --clean"
              env:
                  # Needed so that GoReleaser can publish release artifacts
                  # to GitHub, and create a release.
                  GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
                  HOMEBREW_TAP_GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.HOMEBREW_TAP_GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

## GitHub Actions Repository Secret

To authenticate GoReleaser to publish to our Homebrew Tap, you will need to create a [Fine-grained Personal Access Token (docs.github.com)](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-fine-grained-personal-access-token):

| Option      | Usage                                                                             |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Name        | `HOMEBREW_TAP_GITHUB_TOKEN`                                                       |
| Access on   | **Only select repositories**, and select the HomeBrew Tap `dbtedman/homebrew-tap` |
| Permissions | **Contents (Read/Write)**, and **Metadata (Read Only)**                           |

Keep a record of the token that is generated.

In the code repository for your go binary, define a [Repository Secret (docs.github.com)](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions) `HOMEBREW_TAP_GITHUB_TOKEN` with the value of the token just generated.

## Tag Release

Create a release tag, and push to the remote repository. This will automatically trigger a release pipeline.

```shell
git tag 0.1.0 && git push origin 0.1.0
```

## Test

We are now ready to test our published Homebrew Formula. Install `aquamarine` using the following command.

```shell
brew install dbtedman/tap/aquamarine
```

go based experiments.
